                    At MathGenius-AI, your privacy is our priority. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application. By using the app, you agree to the terms of this policy.
                  </p>
               </div>

               1. Information We Collect
				a. Personal Information
				We do not require users to provide personal information such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers to use most features of the app. However, if you choose to contact us or participate in certain optional features, we may collect personal data that you voluntarily provide.
			</p>

				<p class="box-desc" style="text-align:inherit;">
				b. Non-Personal Information
				We may collect non-identifying information automatically, such as:

				- Device type and operating system

				- Usage statistics (e.g., features accessed, time spent)

				- App performance data (crash logs, error reports)
			</p>
<p class="box-desc" style="text-align:inherit;">
				c. Camera & Image Data
				When using the Math OCR Scanner or Photo Problem Solving features, the app accesses your device’s camera or image gallery. Captured images are processed locally on your device or securely transmitted to our AI engine for solution generation. We do not store or share these images.
</p>
<p class="box-desc" style="text-align:inherit;">
				d. Offline Functionality
				Some features, like the AI-powered math solver, work offline and do not transmit data to our servers. Offline processing ensures your privacy and data security.
			</p>
			<p class="box-desc" style="text-align:inherit;">

				2. How We Use Your Information
				We use collected information to:

				- Provide and improve app functionality

				- Enhance user experience through personalized content

				- Fix bugs, improve performance, and develop new features

				Monitor analytics and usage trends (non-personal)

				We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information to third parties.
			</p>
			<p class="box-desc" style="text-align:inherit;">

				3. Data Security
				We implement industry-standard security practices to protect your data. Although no system is 100% secure, we take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized access, data misuse, or disclosure.
			</p>
			<p class="box-desc" style="text-align:inherit;">

				4. Third-Party Services
				MathGenius-AI may use third-party services (e.g., analytics, crash reporting tools) that collect data in compliance with their own privacy policies. These services are used strictly to enhance app performance and user experience.
			</p>
			<p class="box-desc" style="text-align:inherit;">

				5. Children’s Privacy
				MathGenius-AI is intended for users aged 13 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe your child has provided personal data, please contact us so we can delete it promptly.
			</p>
			<p class="box-desc" style="text-align:inherit;">

				6. User Controls
				Permissions: You can manage app permissions (e.g., camera, storage) through your device settings.
			</p>

				Review & Delete: You may request access to or deletion of any personal data we might hold by contacting us.
			<p class="box-desc" style="text-align:inherit;">

				7. Changes to This Policy
				We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Users will be notified of significant changes via in-app updates or notices. Continued use of the app constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
			</p>
			<p class="box-desc" style="text-align:inherit;">
